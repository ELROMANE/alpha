But I can suggest a few options:\n\n1. **Text-based song representation**: I can represent a song in text form, using lyrics or a musical notation. Would you like me to generate a simple song or provide lyrics to a popular song?\n2. **Music streaming suggestion**: I can suggest a music streaming platform (e.g., Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music) where you can search for and play your favorite songs.\n3. **Generate a musical pattern**: I can generate a simple musical pattern using text-based musical notation (e.g., a short melody or rhythm). Would you like me to create something?\n\nWhich option sounds appealing to you?"
